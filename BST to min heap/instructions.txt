/*
This is a conversion of a binary search tree to a min heap. In this proiblem, implement the algorithm to covert a binary search tree to a minheap. Theere are many ways of doung so however here you willd ot it the way expressed below;


The algorith is done by the following steps:

* create an array arr or size n, where n is the number of nodes in the given bst
* Copy the node values of the tree in the arr[] in sorted order
* While traversing the root during the depth first traversal, one by one copy the values from the arrys arr[] to the nodes of the BST
